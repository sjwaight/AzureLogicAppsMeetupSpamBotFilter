# Azure Logic Apps Meetup Spam Bot Filter

Azure Logic App that shows how you can build a spam bot filter using [Azure Cognitive Services Content Moderator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Content-Moderator/overview) and a [Logic Apps Custom Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/connectors/custom-connectors/)

You can see how the custom connector is built by taking a look at the associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sjwaight/LogicAppsMeetupReadOnlyPublicConnector) that contains the read-only Meetup API Connector I built.
